# Microsoft-Graph-API
Visit Graph API to use the Microsoft service, including email, sharepoint, etc.
The purpose of this work is to clean up the sharepoint folder to see if there are files older than certain age and move them into a separate folder so that they can be removed after a double check. 

`Refresh token' mechanism is used in this project. The token will be refreshed every time.
 
 Every folder in the drive will be visited, conditions will be applied to determine if the file shall be moved.
